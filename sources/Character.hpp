/*                        Character.hpp By Dana Zorohov
    ======================================================================
    This interface specifies a character. 
    A character has a location (of type Point), 
    hit points (represented by an integer) 
    and a name represented by a character string.

    Functions defined on a character:
    - isisAlive(): returns a boolean value if the character is alive 
      (is means that it has more than zero hit points) 
    
    - distance(): receives a pointer to another character and returns the 
      distance between the characters (double)

    - Hit(): gets an integer. Subtracts the appropriate amount of hit 
      points from the character. returns nothing. 

    - getName(): returns the name of the character. 

    - getLocation(): returns the location of the character. 

    - print(): prints the name of the character, the number of it's hit 
      points, and the point where the character is. 
      If the character dies, the number of hit points won't be printed, 
      and the character's name will appear in parentheses. 
      Before the name will appear a letter indicating the type of character: 
      N for ninja and C for Cowboy.
